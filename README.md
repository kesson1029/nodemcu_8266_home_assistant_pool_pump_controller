# NodeMCU ESP8266 Pool Pump Controller with Home Assistant

This project enables you to control a pool pump remotely using a NodeMCU ESP8266 microcontroller integrated with Home Assistant via MQTT. The system allows you to turn the pump on/off manually or automate it based on a schedule, providing a cost-effective solution for pool maintenance.

#### After the first USB flash of the **NodeMCU (ESP8266)**, all subsequent program uploads can be done over Wi-Fi.

This makes it easy to place the **NodeMCU (ESP8266)** control board in a fixed locationâ€”such as the basement near the VFD/controllerâ€”without needing to remove it or bring it back to a USB port or the need for a laptop. **All the ESP8266 requires is a Wi-Fi connection on your local network.**

#### If youâ€™ve ever found yourself wanting to control your pool filter through Home Assistantâ€”like I didâ€”this project might give you a solid starting point. I built this so I could monitor and control the pool filter remotely while we travel. Itâ€™s been helpful for peace of mind, and maybe itâ€™ll be useful for you too.

#### A quick note: this is my first time publishing a project to GitHub, so please go easy on me. Also, the README was mostly generated with the help of AI. If something doesnâ€™t quite make senseâ€¦ letâ€™s just blame the AI. ðŸ˜‰

## Features
- **Remote Control**: Turn the pool pump on/off via Home Assistantâ€™s dashboard or mobile app.
- **Scheduled Automation**: Run the pump on a daily schedule (e.g., on at 8:00 AM, off at 2:00 PM).
- **MQTT Integration**: Communicates with Home Assistant using lightweight MQTT protocol.
- **Reliable State Tracking**: Ensures the pumpâ€™s state is accurately reflected in Home Assistant.
- **Simple Hardware**: Uses a single relay module for easy setup.

## Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of Arduino programming and Home Assistant configuration.
- An MQTT broker (e.g., Mosquitto) installed and running, accessible by both the NodeMCU and Home Assistant.
- A Home Assistant instance (version 2023.6 or later recommended).
- Arduino IDE installed for flashing the NodeMCU.

## Hardware Requirements
- **NodeMCU ESP8266** (e.g., NodeMCU V3).

- **Pool pump** (AC-powered, compatible with relay rating, typically <10A).
- **Jumper wires** and a **breadboard** (optional).
- **5V USB power adapter** for the NodeMCU.
- **Safety equipment**: Electrical enclosure, insulation tape, and tools for AC wiring (consult an electrician if unsure).

**Warning**: Working with high-voltage devices like pool pumps can be dangerous. Ensure all connections are properly insulated and comply with local electrical codes. Consult a licensed electrician for AC wiring.

## Wiring Diagram
![wiring_diagram](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9fe858d5-0e4d-46ed-953d-0b4e7586b404)

Connect the components as follows:

| NodeMCU Pin | Relay Module Pin | Description |
|-------------|------------------|-------------|
| D2 (GPIO4)  | IN               | Relay control signal |
| 3.3V        | VCC              | Relay power (or 5V if required by your module) |
| GND         | GND              | Ground |
| VIN (5V)    | USB adapter      | Power for NodeMCU (via USB or VIN) |

- **AC Wiring**: Connect the relayâ€™s NO (normally open) and COM (common) terminals in series with the pool pumpâ€™s live wire. Ensure the rating matches the pool pumpâ€™s power requirements.
- **Safety**: Place all components in a waterproof enclosure for outdoor use.

**Note**: The `main.ino` code assumes the relay is active-low (HIGH on D2 turns it OFF, LOW turns it ON). Adjust the code if your relay is active-high.

## Software Setup

### Flashing the NodeMCU
1. **Install ESP8266 Board Support**:
   - Open Arduino IDE, go to **File > Preferences**.
   - Add `http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json` to **Additional Boards Manager URLs**.
   - Go to **Tools > Board > Boards Manager**, search for `esp8266`, and install the latest version.
   - Select **NodeMCU 1.0 (ESP-12E Module)** under **Tools > Board**.

2. **Install Libraries**:
   - Install the following libraries via **Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries**:
     - `ESP8266WiFi` (included with ESP8266 board support).
     - `PubSubClient` by Nick Oâ€™Leary (for MQTT).

3. **Configure `main`**:
   - Open `main.ino` from the repository.
   - Update the following variables with your settings:
     ```cpp
     const char* ssid = "YOUR_WIFI_SSID";
     const char* password = "YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD";
     const char* mqtt = "YOUR_MQTT_BROKER_IP";
     const char* mqtt_user = "YOUR_MQTT_USERNAME"; // Optional
     const char* mqtt_password = "YOUR_MQTT_PASSWORD"; // Optional
     ```
   - Ensure `RELAY_PIN` is set to `D2` (GPIO4) or your chosen pin:
     ```cpp
     #define RELAY_PIN D2
     ```

4. **Flash the Code**:
   - Connect the NodeMCU to your computer via USB.
   - Select the correct port under **Tools > Port**.
   - Click **Upload** to flash the code.
   - Open the Serial Monitor (**Tools > Serial Monitor**, 115200 baud) to verify Wi-Fi and MQTT connection.

### Configuring Home Assistant
1. **Add MQTT**:
   - Edit your Home Assistant `configuration.yaml` (typically in `~/.homeassistant/`).
   - Add the following under the `switch:` section:
     ```yaml
     switch:
       - platform: mqtt
         name: "Pool Pump"
         state_topic: "pool_pump/state"
         command_topic: "pool_pump/set"
         payload_on: "ON"
         payload_off: "OFF"
         optimistic: false
         qos: 0
         retain: true
     ```
   - Ensure your MQTT broker is configured in `configuration.yaml`:
     ```yaml
     mqtt:
       broker: YOUR_MQTT_BROKER_IP
       username: YOUR_MQTT_USERNAME # Optional
       password: YOUR_MQTT_PASSWORD # Optional
     ```

2. **Add Automations**:
   - Create or edit `automations.yaml` (ensure itâ€™s included in `configuration.yaml` via `automation: !include automations.yaml`).
   - Add the following to schedule the pool pump (runs from 8:00 AM to 2:00 PM):
     ```yaml
     - id: 'pool_pump_schedule'
       alias: Pool Pump Schedule
       trigger:
         - platform: time
           at: 08:00:00' '08:00'
       condition:
         - condition: state
           entity_id: switch.pool_pump
           state: 'off'
       action:
         - service: switch.turn_on
           entity_id: switch.pool_pump
     - id: 'pool_pump_off_schedule'
       alias: Pool Pump Off Schedule
       trigger:
         - platform: time
           at: '14:00:00'
       condition:
         - condition: state
           entity_id: switch.pool_pump
           state: 'on'
       action:
         - service: switch.turn_off
           entity_id: switch.pool_pump
     ```

3. **Restart Home Assistant**:
   - Save the YAML files and restart Home Assistant via **Configuration > Server Controls > Restart**.
   - Verify the `switch.pool_pump` entity appears in the Home Assistant dashboard under **Overview** or **Entities**.

## Usage
- **Manual Control**: Toggle the `Pool Pump` switch in the Home Assistantâ€™s dashboard or app to turn the pump on/off.
- **Scheduled Operation**: The pump automatically turns on at 8:00 AM and off at 2:00 PM daily, unless manually overridden.
- **Customization**: Edit `automations.yaml` to adjust schedules or add conditions (e.g., weather-based triggers, if supported by your Home Assistant setup).

## Troubleshooting
- **NodeMCU Not Connecting to Wi-Fi**:
  - Check `ssid` and `password` in `main.ino`.
  - Ensure the NodeMCU is within Wi-Fi range.
  - Monitor Serial output for error messages.
- **MQTT Connection Fails**:
  - Verify the MQTT broker IP, username, and password.
  - Ensure the broker is running and accessible (e.g., `mosquitto -v` on the broker machine).
  - Check firewall settings to allow MQTT port (default: 1883).
- **Switch Not Appearing in Home Assistant**:
  - Validate YAML syntax using Home Assistantâ€™s **Configuration > YAML** Validation.
  - Confirm MQTT topics (`pool_pump/state`, `pool_pump/set`) match `main.ino`.
  - Check Home Assistant logs (**Configuration > Logs**) for MQTT errors.
- **Relay Not Switching**:
  - Confirm wiring matches the diagram.
  - Test the relay with a simple Arduino sketch (e.g., toggle `D2` HIGH/LOW).
  - Ensure the relay module supports 3.3V logic or use a level shifter if needed.
